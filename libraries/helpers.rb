class Chef
  # Class that supports the interface between Chef and OSSEC
  module OSSEC
    # Defines methods that return serialized OSSEC data to Chef
    module Helpers
      # Gyoku looks for a symbol called :content! but Chef attributes
      # are always stringified. We can't just call symbolize_keys
      # because we need to recurse through the hash structure. Doing
      # this also gives us the opportunity to convert true/false to
      # yes/no, which is handy.
